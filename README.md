<h1>Shamir's Secret Sharing - Constant Term Calculation</h1>

<h3>This project implements a simplified version of Shamir's Secret Sharing algorithm. It reads polynomial roots from a JSON input, decodes the values from different bases, and calculates the constant term 
ùëê
c of the polynomial using Lagrange interpolation..</h3>

<h2>Features</h2>

Decodes values encoded in various numerical bases.
<br>
Calculates the constant term of a polynomial based on given roots using Lagrange interpolation.
<br>
Reads input from a JSON file for easy modification and testing.
